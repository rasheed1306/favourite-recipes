        <h1> Chicken Corn Soup </h1>
        <p> I love this dish a lot in winter. It pairs well with the cold season and tastes even better when you have a cold</p>

        <h2> Key Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong> Chicken -  </strong> Boil bone-in whole chicken or bone-in thigh meat, both work. I like to boil the whole chicken and use the leftover meat as a sandwich filling.</li>
            <li> <strong> Water - </strong> Three cups and extra for the slurry.</li>
            <li> <strong> Garlic -  </strong>  Minced garlic works or just add a whole clove.</li>
            <li> <strong> White vinegar </strong> Rice vinegar will work just as well.</li>
            <li> <strong> Salt & black pepper </strong> as per measurement or to taste.</li>
            <li> <strong> Corn -  </strong> Cream-style canned corn adds a smoothness and creaminess to this soup, but it does contain added sugar. If you want to avoid that, use canned whole corn kernels.</li>
            <li> <strong> Soy sauce - </strong> Coconut Aminos can be used too</li>
            <li> <strong> Corn flour </strong> Can use Arrowroot powder, or tapioca flour either.</li>
            <li> <strong> Egg -  </strong> Whisked.</li>
            <li> <strong> Garnish </strong> You can use anything from spring onions, boiled chicken, and or chilli flakes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Instructions </h2>
        <p> <strong> Start by making the stock </strong> Add the chicken to a pot of filtered water and add garlic, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Let this boil, covered, on medium-high heat for about 30 minutes or till the chicken is cooked through.</p>
        <p> <strong> Debone & chop.</strong> Once the chicken is cooked, take it out of the stock and debone it. Chop into smaller pieces. Take about 1 cup and set it aside for the soup. The rest can be stored and used in sandwiches, fillings, and wraps.</p>
        <p> <strong> Saute. </strong>  In a separate medium-sized pot, saute the chicken and the corn in oil. About 2 minutes. Next strain the prepared stock into the pot with the chicken and corn and increase the heat to high.</p>
        <p> <strong> Season & thicken. </strong> Add coconut aminos and bring the stock to a rolling boil. In a small bowl prepare the arrowroot slurry by adding some water to the arrowroot powder. Lower the heat to medium-low, add the slurry, and let the soup thicken.</p>
        <p> <strong> Add finishing touches.</strong> Once thick, switch off the heat and add the whipped egg. Leave it undisturbed for 20 seconds before stirring the soup. This will result in thick egg ribbons similar to the way restaurants serve it. Garnish with green onions and enjoy immediately!</p>
